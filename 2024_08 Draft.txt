Comment: 
Basically, both statistical disclosure approaches should be discussed, traditional anonymization and synthetization of data.  
One paper might get too lengthy – possible solution: To have two very similar papers: 
Anonymization of data for open science in psychology: Part I - synthetic data 
Anonymization of data for open science in psychology: Part II - traditional anonymization
(second paper by using the same data set(s) but with very shortened introduction on open science, data sharing and replication crisis)

Title(s): 
Anonymization of data for open science in psychology – Part I: synthetic tabular data
Anonymization of data for open science in psychology – Part II: traditional anonymization of tabular data
(or vice versa, i.e. Part I: traditional anon, Part II: synth data)

Audience: 
Psychologist

Journal:
Decide later, some journal for psychologists
My tip is Collabra: Psychology
https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra
- Collabra: Psychology has 7 sections representing the broad field of psychology, and a highlighted focus area of “Methodology and Research Practice.” 
Are: Cognitive Psychology Social Psychology Personality Psychology Clinical Psychology Developmental Psychology Organizational Behavior Methodology and Research Practice.

Goal: 
Create an article that will explain statistical disclosure methods and showcase an synthetization and traditional anonymization approach on some datasets containing psych data.

Structure: 

• Introduction
	- Discuss the importance of open science and data sharing. (more lengthy on part I, part II paper citing part I paper)
	- Discuss the Replication crisis (more lengthy on part I, part II paper citing part I paper)
	- State the aim of the paper, which is to explain statistical disclosure methods and showcase an anonymization or synthetization approach on a psychological dataset

• Overview of SDC Methods
	- Overview of Anonymization or Synthetization Techniques, Description of SDC Methods
	- Review existing literature on statistical disclosure control methods (with focus on applications in psychology/psychometrics)
	- Discuss specific challenges and considerations or anonymizing or synthetization of data in psychology/psychometrics.
	- Discuss the possibilities on utility measurement
	- Discuss the disclosure scenarios (basically for anonymization: identity and attribute disclosure; for synthetic data: membership and inferential disclosure)


• Case Study: Anonymizing or synthetization a data set from psychology
	- Discuss criteria for selecting appropriate anonymization or synthetization techniques for the case study.
	- Showcase use of SDC methods

• Results
	- Utility Assessment
	- Disclosure Risk Assessment


 • Discussion:
  	- Recommendations and limits on the use of anonymization / synthetization methods
	- Recommendations and limits on the use of utility assessment
 	- Recommendations and limits on the use of disclosure risk measures
	- Challenges due to hierarchical data and cluster structures (e.g., all children in a class are surveyed).
 	- Future research: longitudinal data
