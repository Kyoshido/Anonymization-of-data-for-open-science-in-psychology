The key concepts of statistical disclosure control are presented, along with the methodology and software that can be used to apply various methods of statistical disclosure control.Examples will also be used to illustrate methods described in the book. The handbook is based upon material prepared by the leading National Institute of Statistics in Europe. The context is relevant globally, not just within the EU. "--},
